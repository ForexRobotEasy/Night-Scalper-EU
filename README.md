## Overview

The Night Scalper EU is a Forex trading robot developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to execute trades during the night session on the EUR/USD currency pair. The robot uses technical indicators and price levels to determine entry points and implements risk management strategies to protect against losses.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into several sections:

1. Libraries: The necessary libraries are included to access trade-related functions and constants.

2. Parameters: The user-defined parameters are defined, including the risk percentage per trade, stop-loss percentage, and take-profit percentage.

3. Trade Variables: Variables are defined to store trade-related information such as the trade object, trade action, entry price, stop-loss price, take-profit price, trade volume, and maximum drawdown.

4. Entry Function: The `OpenTrade()` function is responsible for determining entry points, calculating trade volume, and opening trades.

5. Exit Function: The `CloseTrade()` function is used to close open trades.

6. Risk Management Function: The `AdjustRiskParameters()` function adjusts the trade size and stop-loss/take-profit prices based on current drawdown and market conditions.

7. Trade Monitoring Function: The `MonitorTrade()` function retrieves trade information, calculates profit/loss, and prints trade-related details.

8. Main Function: The `OnTick()` function is the entry point of the program. It checks if a trade is open and either opens a new trade or monitors an existing trade. It also adjusts risk parameters and closes trades if necessary.
